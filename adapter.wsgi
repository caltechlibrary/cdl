# The following sets the default directory to the current app's directory, so
# that imports and calls to config(...) work as expected.  It also prevents a
# confusing error of the form "FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory:
# '...../adapter.wsgi'" in the Apache or mod_wsgi logs.

# Mod_wsgi runs this .wsgi adapter with a clean environment; you cannot pass
# arguments to this wrapper, nor set environment variables in os.environ in
# the calling code and then read them here.  Mod_wsgi expects tha you use a
# separate config file or alternative .wsgi scripts for different run-time
# configurations.  That's okay, but it makes it difficult if you want to keep
# things simple and not use multiple adapter files.  So, the approach taken
# here is the following:
#
#  1. dibs_application(...) does a one-time operation to look for environment
#     variables and/or settings.ini values.  It sets a flag and skips the
#     operation on subsequent invocations.
#
#  2. Our run-server control script sets environment variables if the verbose
#     or debug options are given. That's what dibs_application(...) checks for.
#
# Note that THIS ENTRY POINT IS CALLED EVERY TIME a request comes in, for any
# page.  For efficiency, the following code is a bit roundabout but it's to
# avoid things like calling config() every time.
