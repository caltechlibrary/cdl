Introduction
------------

The Caltech Library's DIBS enables members of Caltech to borrow materials (e.g., older books) that are not otherwise available in e-book or other electronic formats.  The system was implemented in the year 2021 to help Caltech students and faculty continue their studies and work during the global [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

The concept of [controlled digital lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_digital_lending) (CDL) is to allow libraries to loan items to digital patrons in a "lend like print" fashion.  The number of digital copies of an item allowed to be loaned at any given time is strictly controlled to match the number of physical print copies taken off the shelves, to ensure an exact "owned-to-loaned" ratio.  DIBS implements two main components of a CDL system: a loan tracking system, and an integrated digital content viewing interface.  DIBS makes use of the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io) to implement the viewer.

Access to materials in Caltech DIBS is limited to current Caltech faculty, students and staff, but the software for DIBS itself is open-sourced under a BSD type license.

Requirements
-----------

DIBS is written in Python 3 and depends on additional software to work.  The [installation instructions](#installation) below describe how to install all of the dependencies.  In summary, in addition to a number of Python packages, DIBS also needs: the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io), used to display content; [Node](https://nodejs.dev) modules used by the Universal Viewer; and [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/), used as the main database for DIBS data.  Finally, authentication is assumed to be handled by a single-signon system (in Caltech's case,  [Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_Single_Sign-on_architecture)) that is external to DIBS.


Installation
------------

### ⓵ _Get the DIBS source code_

To install and run DIBS locally, you will need to clone not just the main repo contents but also submodules.  The minimum command for this involves using the `--recursive` option to `git clone`:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs
```

If you want to get the `develop` branch as well, the easiest approach may be instead to use the script [`git-clone-complete`](https://github.com/mhucka/small-scripts/blob/main/git-scripts/git-clone-complete) for doing deep clones of GitHub repositories:

```sh
git-clone-complete https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs
```

This will create a `dibs` subdirectory in your current directory.


### ⓶ _Install Python dependencies_

Next, install the Python dependencies on your system or your virtual environment:

```sh
cd dibs
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### ⓷ _Install Node dependencies_

Change into to the [`viewer`](viewer) subdirectory, and run the following command to install the Node dependencies for the Universal Viewer:

```sh
cd viewer
npm install
```


Usage: running the server locally
---------------------------------

For demonstration purposes as well as development, it's convenient to run DIBS on your local machine.  The following instructions describe the process, assuming that DIBS has never been configured or run on your system.


### ⓵ _Copy the sample `settings.ini` configuration file_

The file `settings.ini-example` is a sample configuration file for DIBS.  Copy the file to `settings.ini`,

```sh
cp settings.ini-example settings.ini
```

and edit its contents in a text editor to suit your local installation.


### ⓶ _Load a sample book into DIBS_

Prior to starting the DIBS server for the first time, for testing purposes, you may want to add some sample data. This can be done by running the script [`load-mock-data.py`](load-mock-data.py):

```sh
python3 load-mock-data.py
```


### ⓷ _Load a sample user into DIBS_

The program [`people-manager`](people-manager) is an interface to adding and manipulating user data.  To log into the demo DIBS configuration, create at least one user with a role of "library".  Suppose you want to name your sample user "dibsuser", then you could run the following command:

```sh
./people-manager add role="library" uname=dibsuser
```


### ⓸ _Start the DIBS server_

For local experimentation and development, the script [`run-server`](run-server) can be used to start a local copy of the server.  It assumes you are in the current directory, and it takes a few arguments for controlling its behavior:

```sh
./run-server -h
```

In a real installation, DIBS needs a single-signon system on the server to provide user authentication.  This is not the situation in a local development server, and so for demo/debugging purposes, the `run-server` command lets you tell DIBS that a specific user has already been authenticated.  Using the example user from above, you can start a local DIBS server in debug mode like this:

```
./run-server -m debug -u dibsuser
```

By default it starts the server on `localhost` port 8080.  Using the `debug` run mode changes the behavior in various useful ways, such as to reload the source files automatically if any of them are edited, and to run `pdb` upon any exceptions.  (These would not be enabled in a production server.)


General information
-------------------

The docs are available online at [https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs/](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs/).  They are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  The sources are kept in the [`docs`](./docs) subdirectory.  The [`README.md`](./docs/README.md) file in the [`docs`](./docs) subdirectory explains how to build and preview the documentation locally.


Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

DIBS is in active development.  The current version was produced rapidly, and some of its current features are a consequence of working towards a minimal viable product as quickly as possible.  We continue to improve DIBS in various ways.

It is worth mentioning that DIBS does not (currently) implement a queue for loan requests.  This is a conscious design decision.  Queuing systems tend to lead to complexity quickly, and we want to delay implementing a queue until it becomes clear that it's really essential.  (After all, in a physical library, there are no queues for borrowing books: you go to see if it's available, and if it's not, you can't borrow it.)  Perhaps we can implement interfaces and behaviors in DIBS that avoid the need for a queue at all!
