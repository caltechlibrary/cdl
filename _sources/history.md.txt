_"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."_ &mdash; [Charles F. Brennan](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/12/13/swap-ideas/).


## Origin story

[Controlled digital lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_digital_lending) (CDL) is an approach for making print books available to digital patrons in a "lend like print" fashion. Although the concept of CDL predates the start of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in 2020, the need for educational institutions to support remote access to their collections during 2020â€“2021 resulted in renewed interest in CDL systems. Like many institutions, the [Caltech Library](https://www.library.caltech.edu) sought to satisfy requests for electronic access from quarantined course instructors and patrons in late 2020, but we found no suitable off-the-shelf system that could provide access to digitized publications in a manner that mimics the loaning of legally-purchased materials.  We implemented Caltech DIBS ("_**Di**gital **B**orrowing **S**ystem_") in response.

The DIBS software system is the work of <a href="https://github.com/mhucka">Michael Hucka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel">Robert Doiel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/t4k">Tommy Keswick</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nosivads">Stephen Davison</a> from the Caltech Library's <a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754">Digital Library Development team</a>. The software is written primarily in Python and uses the JavaScript-based <a href="http://universalviewer.io">Universal Viewer</a> for displaying scanned books and other items that comply with the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF).  The icons used on DIBS pages are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, with additional special icons created by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/roywj/">Royyan Wijaya</a>, <a href="https://thenounproject.com/thezyna/">Scott Desmond</a> and <a href="https://thenounproject.com/slidegenius">SlideGenius</a> for the <a href="https://thenounproject.com">Noun Project</a>.

## Version history

The following subsections summarize the major released versions of DIBS.

### Version 0.3.0

[Release 0.3.0](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/releases/tag/v0.3.0) of DIBS polishes the user interface and, uses the latest official release of the Universal Viewer (version 3.1.1), and fixes some user interface glitches. As of May 20201, the California Institute of Technology Library is running this version as its live DIBS service for the Caltech community. We believe the software to be stable enough for others to try to use it; however, there remain hard-coded references to Caltech in the HTML files and these would need to be edited manually to modify the system for use in other institutions.
