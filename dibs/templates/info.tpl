        </h2>
        <p class="my-3"><strong>Caltech DIBS</strong> is an implementation of <a target="_blank" href="https://controlleddigitallending.org">Controlled Digital Lending</a>, allowing members of Caltech to borrow materials that are not otherwise available in e-book or other electronic formats.  The system was implemented in the year 2021 to help Caltech students and faculty during the global <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19 pandemic.</a> Access to materials in Caltech DIBS is limited to current Caltech faculty, students and staff.</p>
        <p class="my-3">
          The following policies are implemented by the system:
          <ol>
            <li class="my-2">The number of copies of each item is determined by the number of physical copies of the corresponding printed work that the Caltech Library has pulled from the shelves. (This is typically only one, or a very small number.)</li>
            <li class="my-2">Each user may borrow only one item total from the system at any given time.</li>
            <li class="my-2">After returning an item, users cannot borrow that same item again for a period of one hour. They can, however, borrow other items immediately.</li>
          </ol>
