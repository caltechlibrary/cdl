'''
database.py: object definitions for the database

This uses Peewee (http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/), a small ORM that
allows writing database code entirely in terms of Python objects without
having to know much about SQL.

# Each item available for loaning out gets a separate Item object in the
# database.  We may allow more than one simultaneous loan of a given item, so
# that's why there's a num_copies field to represent how many copies of the
# thing we're allowed to loan.  The duration is set per-item because we could
# very well allow some items to be loaned out for longer periods than others.
# Duration is in terms of hours right now.
#
# The TIND Id is not strictly necessary for our purposes, but it's here to
# make it easier for administrators to jump from the list page to the record
# in TIND.

# Loans are currently stored in terms of a combination of item + user identity.
# A user can have multiple items out; they just get represented as separate
# Loan object instances. Similarly, an Item can be loaned to multiple people,
# if there are multiple copies of the item.
#
# Loans periods could be represented as start + duration, but since we'll need
# to test against the end of a loan repeatedly, it's easier to store the end
# time here.

    started = DateTimeField()           # When did the patron start the loan?
    endtime = DateTimeField()           # When does the loan end?
