# Using DIBS

This page describes how DIBS works from the users' standpoint.  A separate section in this document describes the [system architecture](architecture.html#architecture--page-root) that implements the functionality described here.


## Authentication

Authentication is assumed to be handled by the system hosting DIBS. In Caltech's case, we use [Shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_Single_Sign-on_architecture), an institute-wide, single-signon system for authentication. This means is that a sign-in page is presented before users ever reach DIBS, by an authentication layer implemented by the web server. The screenshot below shows an example of this:

DIBS itself does not do anything beyond distinguishing between regular users and those who have staff priviledges (discussed below).


## Top level

The current design of DIBS is focused on helping instructors and students enrolled in classes.  DIBS provides fairly distinct experiences for patrons on the one hand, and staff on the other; this separation is due to expectations about how different classes of users will interact with the system:

1. We expect that patrons looking for materials to borrow will be informed about the availability of specific items via course syllabi or similar resources produced by course instructors.  Consequently, DIBS does not currently expose to patrons a separate index of "all things available for digital loan via DIBS"; in part, this is because such a list was not considered to be useful for DIBS's use-cases, and in part because in the future we expect to add links directly to Caltech's TIND database.
2. We expect that library staff need to interact with the system in a quite different way: to add new items to the database of digitized works and control loan parameters.  Thus, staff _do_ see a list of all items available through the system, but access to this list is limited to Library staff.

These considerations explain the front page of DIBS, which (perhaps contrary to expectations), lacks a login/sign-in interface or a list of items.  This is because in normal use, we expect that users will go straight either to a page describing an individual item or to the staff entry point.  The front page acts mainly as an information page that describes the purpose of the system and the loan policies:

## The patron experience

As mentioned above, patrons are presumed to be provided information about specific items available for loan.  The working assumption is that they will be given URLs that take them directly to item description pages in DIBS.  An example of an item description page is shown below:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/item-page.png">
</figure>

The item description page provides basic information about a particular title available through DIBS, along with a button to request a digital loan.  The information about the title is derived from Caltech's [TIND](https://info.tind.io/ILS) server based on the barcode used by Library staff when they add the item to DIBS. 

The text and button shown in the lower half of the page change based on the current availability of the item. The page will show a  <span class="button color-primary">Get loan</span> button if the item is available for loan at that time.  If the item is not available to the patron, the button changes to <span class="button color-not-available">Not available</span>, and in addition, the text above the button provides information about why it is not available and when it will be available again:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/item-not-available.png">
</figure>

If the item is available to the user, and they click the <span class="button color-primary">Get loan</span> button, then they will be presented with a brief confirmation dialog.  If they elect to proceed, a loan will be started immediately and they will be transferred to the viewer.

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/loan-in-viewer.png">
</figure>

DIBS uses [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io) for this purpose; UV is an open-source browser-based media viewer that works with content described in [IIIF](https://iiif.io/community/faq/) format.  The loan has a limited time duration; the end time is shown in the upper left portion of the viewer screen.  

The patron can elect to end the loan early.  If they do, the viewer will close and they will be presented with a thank-you page that also includes a link to a feedback page:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/loan-ended.png">
</figure>

In designing DIBS, we sought to minimize the amount of patron data requested and stored, to maintain patron privacy and reduce the impact of potential data leaks.  DIBS does not store any patron information when a loan is not in effect (after the lock-out period on a title that was just borrowed), and during a loan, it stores only the user's institutional single-signon (SSO) identity combined with the (single) title they have on loan during the loan period.  There are no provisions in the software for retaining the information past the loan period, or tracking identities or loan statistics based on users.


## The staff experience

Overall, the workflow to add new items to DIBS is simple: staff scan books and store the results in a secure location (one with a shared file system accessible to the DIBS server) and add basic metadata to the DIBS database. Once the item is added to DIBS and flagged as ready to be loaned, a web page for the item allows institutional patrons to request time-limited loans and view the items in the Universal Viewer.  (That is the [patron experience](#the-patron-experience) described in the previous section.)


### How users are identified as staff users

As mentioned at the beginning of this page, users are authenticated by a separate software layer before they can access DIBS, which simplifies DIBS's implementation and reduces what it must do to distinguish different user roles.  By default, every authenticated user is assumed to have basic priviledges, so all that is needed is to tell DIBS which users should have staff priviledges. DIBS comes with a command-line utility program called [`people-manager`](../people-manager) for that purpose.  For example, to add a user with identity `fakeuser2021@caltech.edu` as a staff user, a system administrator needs to run the following command on the server where DIBS is installed:

```sh
./people-manager add uname="fakeuser2021@caltech.edu" role="library"
```


### Additional pages available to staff users

Users with staff priviledges see additional links in the upper-right hand corner menu on every page presented by DIBS. In particular, the menu provides access to the content list and statistics pages, as shown in the screenshot below:

### The list page

Staff are redirected to the main entry point for staff, which is the list page located at `/list`:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/list-page.png">
</figure>

As its name implies, the list page provides a list all of the items known to DIBS (whether they are ready to be available for digital loans or not), and allows staff to add, edit, or remove items.  It is also the place where staff can get the link to be distributed to patrons to request loans.  In more detail:

* **Barcode**: the barcode identifying the item in the Caltech Library.
* **Title**: the title of the item. This is entered free-form in the DIBS entry form and does not have to match the actual title in Caltech's TIND database.
* **Author**: the author of the item. This is entered free-form in the DIBS entry form and does not have to match the actual author in Caltech's TIND database.
* **Available to loan?**: when unchecked, the item is not made available for digital loans. This allows staff who scan the items to start making an entry in DIBS and continue scanning. When done, staff can check the "Available to loan?" checkbox and make it available to digital patrons.
* **Loan duration**: the duration of a loan. The system automatically closes the loan after the loan period and blocks the patron's access. (Patrons can also close loans early if they wish.)
* **Copies for loans**: how many copies of the item are being made available for simultaneous borrowing?
* <span class="button color-secondary">Copy link</span>: this copies to the user's clipboard a link to the item loan page.  This is what should be communicated to course instructors, so that they can pass on the URLs to their students.
* <span class="button color-info">Edit entry</span>: edit the entry. This brings up the same form as is used to add new entries, but with the values filled in, allowing the user to change the values and save the results.


### Adding new items

At the bottom of the list page, there are two buttons named <span class="button color-primary">Add new item</span> and  <span class="button color-danger">Manage item list</span>.

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/bottom-of-list-page.png">
</figure>

If the user clicks the <span class="button color-primary">Add new item</span> button, they are presented with the following screen:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/add-item-page.png">
</figure>

Here, information can be entered to describe a new item being made available for digital loans.  All of the information about a given item is based on the barcode; this barcode is used to look up the item in Caltech's TIND server, and the information extracted from TIND is used to populate the item view page discussed in the previous section.


### Managing items

If the user clicks the <span class="button color-danger">Manage item list</span> button, they are presented with the following screen:

<figure>
    <img src="_static/media/manage-item-list-page.png">
</figure>

In the current version of DIBS, this page only implements one action. Clicking the <span class="button color-danger">Delist</span> button removes the entry for the item in the DIBS database. (This does not remove the manifest, scans, or other files, only the database entry.) In future versions of DIBS, the management page may include additional operations.
