# History

[Controlled digital lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_digital_lending) (CDL) is an approach for making print books available to digital patrons in a "lend like print" fashion. Although the concept of CDL predates the start of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in 2020, the need for educational institutions to support remote access to their collections during 2020â€“2021 resulted in renewed interest in CDL systems. Like many institutions, the [Caltech Library](https://www.library.caltech.edu) sought to satisfy requests for electronic access from quarantined course instructors and patrons in late 2020, but we found no suitable off-the-shelf system that could provide access to digitized publications in a manner that mimics the loaning of legally-purchased materials.  We implemented Caltech DIBS ("_**Di**gital **B**orrowing **S**ystem_") in response.

DIBS is the work of <a href="https://github.com/mhucka">Michael Hucka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rsdoiel">Robert Doiel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/t4k">Tommy Keswick</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nosivads">Stephen Davison</a> from the Caltech Library's <a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754">Digital Library Development team</a>. The software is written primarily in Python and uses the <a href="http://universalviewer.io">Universal Viewer</a> for displaying scanned books and other items that comply with the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF).  The icons used on DIBS pages are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a>, with additional special icons created by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/roywj/">Royyan Wijaya</a>, <a href="https://thenounproject.com/thezyna/">Scott Desmond</a> and <a href="https://thenounproject.com/slidegenius">SlideGenius</a> for the <a href="https://thenounproject.com">Noun Project</a>.
