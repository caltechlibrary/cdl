This documentation was written by [Michael Hucka](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~mhucka/).

The source files use [MyST-flavored Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) extension to [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-sphinx.yml) takes care of creating the formatted version of the documentation and hosting it on GitHub.io at https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs. The formatted output can also be produced manually using commands implemented in the [Makefile](Makefile) located in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs/tree/main/docs) subdirectory of the DIBS source code repository.
