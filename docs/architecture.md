# System architecture

This page describes the system archicture of DIBS.


## Configuration

Settings are stored in the file [`settings.ini`](../settings.ini).  This file is read at run time by the server and database components.


## Database

The definition of the database is in [`dibs/database.py`](../dibs/database.py).  The interface is defined in terms of high-level objects that are backed by an SQLite database back-end.  The ORM used is [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/).

Worth knowing: Peewee queries are lazy-executed: they return iterators that must be accessed before the query is actually executed.  Thus, when selecting items, the following returns a Peewee `ModelSelector`, and not a single result or a list of results:

```python
Item.select().where(Item.barcode == barcode)
```

and you can't call something like Python's `next(...)` on this because it's an iterator and not a generator.  You have to either use a `for` loop, or create a list from the above before you can do much with it.  Creating lists in these cases would be inefficient, but we have so few items to deal with that it's not a concern currently.


## Server

## Endpoints

The definition of the service endpoints and the behaviors is in [`dibs/server.py`](../dibs/server.py).  The endpoints are implemented using [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org).  Here is a summary of the endpoints implemented by the system:

| Endpoint                 | Type | Purpose              |
|--------------------------|------|----------------------|
| `/`                      | GET  | General information page about the system |
| `/info`                  | GET  | Same as `/` |
| `/login`                 | GET  | Shows the login page |
| `/login`                 | POST | Accepts form from login page |
| `/logout`                | GET  | Logs out current user |
| `/list`                  | GET  | Show what's available for loan |
| `/add`                   | GET  | Show the page to add an item |
| `/edit/<barcode>`        | GET  | Show the page to edit an item |
| `/update/add`            | POST | Accepts form input from add-item page |
| `/update/edit`           | POST | Accepts form input from edit-item page | 
| `/ready`                 | POST | Handles checkbox in `list` page to make an item ready to loan |
| `/remove`                | POST | Handles button in `list` page to remove an item |
| `/item/<barcode>`        | GET  | Shows item information page for a given item |
| `/loan`                  | POST | Handles Loan button from `/item` page |
| `/view/<barcode>`        | GET  | Show the item in the viewer page |
| `/return/<barcode>`      | GET  | Handles Return button from viewer page |
| `/manifests/<barcode>`   | GET  | Sends manifest to viewer |
| `/thankyou`              | GET  | Destination after user uses Return button |
| `/notauthenticated`      | GET  | Error page for unathenticated users |
| `/nonexistent`           | GET  | Error page for nonexistent items |
| `/nonexistent/<barcode>` | GET  | Error page for nonexistent items |



## Architectural notes

### _About Peewee_

The definition of the database is in [`dibs/database.py`](dibs/database.py).  The interface is defined in terms of high-level objects that are backed by an SQLite database back-end.  The ORM used is [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/).

Worth knowing: Peewee queries are lazy-executed: they return iterators that must be accessed before the query is actually executed.  Thus, when selecting items, the following returns a Peewee `ModelSelector`, and not a single result or a list of results:

```python
Item.select().where(Item.barcode == barcode)
```

and you can't call something like Python's `next(...)` on this because it's an iterator and not a generator.  You have to either use a `for` loop, or create a list from the above before you can do much with it.  Creating lists in these cases would be inefficient, but we have so few items to deal with that it's not a concern currently.


### _About Bottle_

The definition of the service endpoints and the behaviors is in [`dibs/server.py`](dibs/server.py).  The endpoints are implemented using [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org).

The web server used at the moment is the development server provided by Bottle.  It has live reload built-in, meaning that changes to the `.py` files are picked up automatically and the server updates its behavior on the fly.

See http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#auto-reloading for an important note about Bottle: when it's running in auto-reload mode, _"the main process will not start a server, but spawn a new child process using the same command line arguments used to start the main process. All module-level code is executed at least twice"_.  This means some care is needed in how the top-level code is written.  Useful to know is that code can distinguish whether it's in the parent or child process by looking for the presence of the environment variable `'BOTTLE_CHILD'` set by Bottle in the child process.
