Caltech's DIBS is not the only CDL implementation, nor is it the first. The following are others that the developers of DIBS are aware of:

* The [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) is an open library catalog and digital lending system implemented by the Internet Archive. The [source code is available from GitHub](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/).

* Princeton University Library has implemented CDL using [Figgy](https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy), an open-source digital repository application [they developed](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-collections/digital-pul/technology).  Like DIBS, it uses IIIF and the Universal Viewer.

* Fordham University developed [G-CDL](https://github.com/Fordham-University-Libraries/G-CDL), an open-source CDL system that uses Google Drive as its backend.

* [Alma Digital](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/controlled-digital-lending-with-existing-tools-in-the-toolbox-alma-digital/) is a commercial repository system that's part of [ExLibris Alma](https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/). It supports digital lending, including control on number of concurrent users, cooling-off periods, and more.

* DLSG's [Directed Lending Solution](https://www.dlsg.com) is another commercial system for digital lending.
