Caltech Library Digital Borrowing System
========================================

Caltech DIBS ("_**Di**gital **B**orrowing **S**ystem_") is the [Caltech Library](https://www.library.caltech.edu)'s basic implementation of a [controlled digital lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_digital_lending) system.  It enables members of Caltech to borrow materials that are not otherwise available in e-book or other electronic formats.  The system was implemented in the year 2021 to help Caltech students and faculty during the global [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Access to materials in Caltech DIBS is limited to current Caltech faculty, students and staff, but the software for DIBS itself is open-sourced under a BSD type license and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs).
