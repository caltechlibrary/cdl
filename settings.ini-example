# For production use, we highly recommend that DIBS be placed behind a single
# sign-on authentication system such as Shibboleth.  For testing & development,
# or internal use behind a firewall, you could also use Apache's Basic AuthType
# scheme.  If you do, unset the following variables and match the location of
# the password file to wherever you configured it in your Apache config file.
#HTPASSWD = /usr/bin/htpasswd
#PASSWORD_FILE = /path/to/dibs/here/password.txt

# Path to the sqlite database, relative to here.
DATABASE_FILE = dibs.db

# Directory containing IIIF manifest files.  Each file name should follow the
# pattern "NNNNNN-manifest.json", where NNNNNN is the item barcode.  The repo
# for DIBS contains a subdirectory called "manifests" with a demo file in it,
# but the path can be changed if you put your manifests elsewhere.
MANIFEST_DIR = manifests

# Directory containing status files for items being processed.  Our workflow
# involves some automated conversion of scans to a format suitable for IIIF,
# and this process is initiated by staff users.  While processing is happening,
# DIBS looks in this directory for files that indicate the current status.
STATUS_FILES_DIR = manifests

# IIIF server base path.  Include the protocol version.
IIIF_BASE_URL = https://yourserver.com/iiif/2

# DIBS caches pages it fetches from the IIIF server.  This sets the size of
# the least-recently used cache to the given number of images.
IIIF_CACHE_SIZE = 50000

# DIBS sends the patron email after they borrow an item.  The destination
# address is the sign-on received from the authentication layer.  The
# following variables set the mail server details.  Note that for this to
# work, the account owning the web server process must be able to send email.
MAIL_HOST   = localhost

# Time a user must wait between when they return a title and when they can
# loan it out again (in minutes).

# menu in the upper right of every page (it's link for "Give feedback").

# The following run mode options are recognized:
#   "normal":  use adapter.wsgi without special options
#   "verbose": use adapter.wsgi with verbose logging options
# When started using the program run-server included with DIBS, this value
# maybe overriden by command-line options given to run-server.
