# When running locally using run-server, the following options are recognized:
#   "normal": run adapter.wsgi in mod_wsgi-express without special options
#   "test":   run adapter.wsgi in mod_wsgi-express with some debugging options
#   "debug":  run Bottle's default server with full debugging options
# When running in an Apache2 mod_wsgi environment, adapter.wsgi is always
# used and both "test" and "debug" have the same effect, which is only to turn
# Bottle's debug options (which provides more verbose logging, disables
# template caching, and display tracebacks in web pages when errors occur).
